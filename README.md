High-frequency dynamics of spot exchange rates around surprize monetary policy announcements at the onset of the COVID19 pandemic

# synopsis
As COVID-19 and quarantine measures induced thereby were causing havoc in economies and on financial markets in early 2020, governments and central banks were responding by providing stimulus and easing prudential requirements and monetary policy conditions. A popular measure resorted to by central banks was reduction of policy rates, most frequently unscheduled and sometimes as large as four times the ``standard'' 25 basis points size. In this short paper, I provide evidence that the two cuts initiated bz the Federal open market committee (FOMC) of the United States were followed by abnormally large albeit short-lived depreciation of the US dollar, while the cuts undertaken in other economies had little to none effect on the local currencies.
